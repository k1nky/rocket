You can upload ([rocket]) file several ways:

1. By client, just download bash client from {{ url }}/client and run `bash rocket` for help usage.

curl -O -J {{ url }}/client

or

wget --content-disposition {{ url }}/client

2. By curl, send POST request to {{ url }}/upload with binary data from file or inline. For example,

curl -X POST --data-binary @~/myfile {{ url }}/upload

or from stdin

echo ~/myfile | curl -X POST --data-binary @- {{ url }}/push

After `rocket` you give short link and md5 hash on your file

For downloading a file use the short link like as,

curl -O -J {{ url }}/get/<id>

or

wget --content-disposition {{ url }}/get/<id>
